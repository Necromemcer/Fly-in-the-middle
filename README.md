Game "Fly in the middle" (orig. rus. "Муха в центре"):

- Imagine a 3-by-3 square grid with a fly sitting in the middle section.
- The fly can move in four directions - up, down, left, right.
- Narrator announces the sequence of moves, and the player, while following the moves in their mind's eye, has to press "Space" when they assume the fly has left the grid (critical move was made).
- The game indicates whether your guess was correct, and if so - shows the reaction time.

It is possible to play on a 4-by-4 (2:2 start coordinate) and 5-by-5 grid, as well as to modify the time interval in-between the announced moves (1.5 sec default).

To play the game download the script and execute in the terminal:
